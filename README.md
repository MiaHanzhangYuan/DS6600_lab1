1. I chose the GNU GPLv3 license because after going through the  choose license website, I found this license has permissions of commercial use, distribution and modification while restrict on the same license. 

2. If I hadn't supplied a license, then the author would have the exclusive copyright, which can lead to many difficulties when others want to use my code. There would also be troubles when I was working with others in a group projects because everyone has the copyright, then it would be illegal to use the project without permissions from all other contributors.


3. The relevant section of "A file named '.env' will not be pushed to GitHub":

# Environments
